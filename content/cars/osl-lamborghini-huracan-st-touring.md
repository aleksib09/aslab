*EXTRA A = Hide front plate*

RWD Huracan Performante with custom bodykit based on various racing Huracans but with a smaller wing. Think of it as a ST Touring. Interior has been adjusted to give a slightly less sporty and a bit more of a luxurious feel.


- Check the extension folder to remove the spoiler or permenantly remove the front plate
