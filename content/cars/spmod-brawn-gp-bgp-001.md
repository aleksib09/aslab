The Brawn BGP 001 was a legendary Formula One car used by Brawn GP during the 2009 Formula One World Championship. Originally developed by Honda Racing F1, it was later completed by Brawn GP after Honda withdrew from the sport. The car was powered by a Mercedes-Benz FO 108W 2.4L V8 engine, producing around 750 hp.

Driven by Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello, the BGP 001 dominated the season, winning 8 out of 17 races and securing both the Constructors' Championship and Drivers' Championship (Button). It was famous for its double diffuser, which gave it a significant aerodynamic advantage.

This car remains one of the most remarkable success stories in F1 historyâ€”winning both titles in its only season before the team transitioned into Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team
