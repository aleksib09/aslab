It's based on the Aventador's naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12, but it's been tweaked to deliver 770 horsepower — up from 690 — and rev all the way up to 8,600 rpm. As a result, the Centenario hits 60 mph from a stop in just 2.8 seconds, faster than you can say “happy 100th birthday, Ferrucio Lamborghini!”May 17, 2016

Lamborghini developed the Centenario to showcase the advancement of new technologies and also as a test bed for the development of new Lamborghini models. 

The Centenario is the first Lamborghini automobile to have three exhausts and to be deployed with rear-wheel steering.[citation needed] The system is designed to provide added maneuverability at low speed, in a city driving environment, and improved stability at high speed. 

This is also the first Lamborghini model to be equipped with the company's new infotainment system. The system consists of a new 10.1-inch portrait screen which also records telemetry, driving data and top speeds. 

The car's all-new bodywork from the Aventador also serves as a base for showcasing the new aerodynamic advancements. A twin-deck splitter at the front helps in generating downforce as well as to let air pass through the side of the car while working in conjunction with the side blades. The Centenario also has the largest rear diffusers to ever be incorporated into a car. The diffusers along with the electronically controlled twin deck rear-wing aids further in generating downforce. The car generates 227 kg (500 lb) of downforce at 280 km/h (174 mph).

In 2018, 11 of the 40 Centenarios were recalled due to being fit with an improper weight rating label.
