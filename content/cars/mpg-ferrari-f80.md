Ferrari F80 2026 by MPG Mods Free Download

In October 2024, Ferrari unveiled its newest limited-production hypercar, the F80, as a successor to the LaFerrari and in the lineage of iconic models like the 288 GTO, F40, F50, and Enzo. This exclusive model, with a production run of just 799 units, all of which were reportedly pre-sold, is set to commence deliveries in early 2026 with an approximate price tag of $3.9 million (€3.6 million).   

The F80 represents a significant shift in Ferrari's powertrain philosophy for its flagship model, moving away from a naturally aspirated V12 to a Formula 1-inspired hybrid system. At its heart lies a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged 120° V6 engine derived from the Ferrari 499P Le Mans winner, producing 900 PS (662 kW; 888 hp). 
This is coupled with three electric motors – two at the front and one at the rear (MGU-K) – resulting in a combined power output of 1,200 PS (883 kW; 1,184 hp), making it the most powerful road car ever produced by Ferrari. The hybrid system features an 800-volt architecture and a 2.28 kWh battery developed in-house.   

The F80 boasts impressive performance figures, with a claimed 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) acceleration in just 2.15 seconds and 0-200 km/h (0-124 mph) in 5.75 seconds. The top speed is stated to be 350 km/h (217 mph). Power is delivered to all four wheels via an 8-speed dual-clutch F1 DCT transmission.   

Aerodynamics played a crucial role in the F80's design, with active elements such as a rear wing, front triplane wing integrated into the S-Duct, and an advanced underbody contributing to over 1000 kg of downforce at 250 km/h. The chassis utilizes a multi-material approach, with a carbon fiber tub and composite materials for the cell and roof, while aluminum subframes are used at the front and rear.   

The interior adopts a "1+" configuration, emphasizing the driver-centric design. The driver's seat is distinctively colored red and positioned slightly ahead of the passenger seat, which is more integrated into the cabin trim. A digital gauge cluster serves as the primary display, with physical buttons returning to the steering wheel for key controls. Notably, a storage space behind the seats can accommodate a 24-hour suitcase, a first for a Ferrari supercar.   

The Ferrari F80 blends cutting-edge hybrid technology and extreme aerodynamics with a design language that nods to Ferrari's heritage while embracing a futuristic aesthetic, positioning it as a true engineering marvel and a highly coveted collectible.
