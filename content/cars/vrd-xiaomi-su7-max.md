Xiaomi EV's first product - the highly anticipated Xiaomi SU7, has been "pre-launched," with its design, performance, range, safety, and other details making global debut. Positioned as a "full-size high-performance eco-technology sedan," Xiaomi SU7 aims to push the limits of performance, ecosystem, and mobile smart space. 

Quoting a sentence of Chinese poetry, "with firm strides we are crossing its summit." Lei Jun, founder, chairman, and CEO of Xiaomi Group, stated that Xiaomi's entry into the automotive industry marks a significant leap from the smartphone industry and a crucial step toward closing the loop of the Human x Car x Home smart ecosystem. Lei Jun further expressed that the century-old automotive industry offers little room for maneuvering today: "Xiaomi has decided to invest tenfold, starting from the development of fundamental core technologies, committing to constructing an outstanding vehicle. Through 15 to 20 years of effort, Xiaomi aims to become one of the top five global automakers.
