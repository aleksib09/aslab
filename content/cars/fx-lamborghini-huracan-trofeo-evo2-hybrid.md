Hi everyone! After the long break, I can finally finish this car which has been a WIP since so long ago. The main idea is clear, a street-legal version of the race car Huracan Super Trofeo EVO2, with a little twist. This thing uses a V10 hybrid, making the output of 700HP & 696Nm of torque, combined with an RWD drivetrain, making it a very powerful track weapon.

I hope you enjoy the car as much as I do. Thank you!

**V1.05 CHANGELOG:**

 
Re-adjusted the power output. Now the car puts out 700 HP | 696Nm
 
Re-adjusted brake power & handling to match the power output
 
Fixed rear number plate light
**FEATURES:**

 
- Encryption = NO
 
- RainFX, Working wipers
 
- LODs = YES (LOD A,B,C,D + Cockpit LR)
 
- Working CM Paintshop
 
- Working Digital Cluster
 
- Android Auto
 
- Extra Button A = Left Door
 
- Extra Button B = Right Door
 
- Extra Button C = Interior Overhead Light
