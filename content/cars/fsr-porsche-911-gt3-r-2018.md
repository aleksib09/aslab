Based on the 911 GT3 RS production sports car, the 911 GT3 R has been designed as customer sport race car for GT3 series around the world.


In developing the more than 368 kW (500 hp) racing nine-eleven, special attention was paid to lightweight design, better aerodynamic efficiency, reducing consumption, improved handling, further optimised safety as well as lowering service and spare parts costs.


The lightweight body design of the 911 GT3 RS production sports car featuring intelligent aluminium-steel composite construction has proven to be the ideal basis for the race car and its cutting-edge four-litre flat-six unit is largely identical to the high-performance production engine of the road-legal model.
