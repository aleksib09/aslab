‌ Xiaomi launched the ultimate performance technology sedan -- Xiaomi SU7 Ultra. As the high-performance flagship EV of Xiaomi, Xiaomi SU7 Ultra is designed for high-performance driving by combining exceptional performance with cutting-edge technology to deliver an extraordinary driving experience. It is perfect for both daily driving and hitting the track.

Xiaomi SU7 Ultra is equipped with the same tri-motor configuration and track-optimized battery pack as Xiaomi SU7 Ultra Prototype (prototype car), delivering a maximum horsepower of 1548PS. With 0-100km/h acceleration in only 1.98s (without one foot rollout), and a designed maximum speed of 350km/h, it is built to be the fastest four-door mass-produced car. Xiaomi SU7 Ultra features a track-optimized cooling system, ensuring it can complete two laps on the Nürburgring Nordschleife without overheating.

It is also equipped with a top-level braking system, achieving a braking distance of only 30.8m from 100km/h to 0. Xiaomi SU7 Ultra also comes with a peak chassis system tuned for the Nürburgring Nordschleife, delivering better chassis control and a higher control ceiling. As a four-door "race car", it is track-ready straight from the factory. In addition, the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra offers multiple upgrades in smart driving, smart cockpit, safety and luxury experience.‌
