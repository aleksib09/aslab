#### Mercedes-AMG Project One

</center>

The Mercedes-AMG One (R50, stylized as ONE) is a limited-production plug-in hybrid sports car manufactured by Mercedes-AMG, featuring Formula One-derived technology. It was unveiled at the 2017 International Motor Show Germany by Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and Head of Mercedes-Benz Dieter Zetsche.The production of the car is planned to be 275 units at a price of US$2.72 million per unit, all of which have been already sold. Mercedes-AMG received orders for four times the production number, but have stated that production will not be increased from the planned 275 units, in order to maintain the exclusivity of the car.

Currently, the car is the cover car for Forza Horizon 5, On June 1 2022, Mercedes-AMG revealed the production version of the AMG One.

Development:

AMG unveiled the concept version of the ONE, called the Project One, with nearly identical specifications to the production version. The production ONE will be evaluated on their performance, durability, and ability in Mercedes-Benz's proving grounds and on racing circuits. The head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers states that when "the time is right", Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team driver and seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, who has worked on the development of the car, will test the prototypes.

Production:

The production version of the AMG One unveiled on June 1, 2022. Production is limited to 275 units worldwide and will begin in late 2022. Notably, seven-time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton purchased two AMG Ones, of which one is to be gifted to his father Anthony.[9][10] Other owners of the AMG One include former Formula One driver David Coulthard, 2016 Formula One World Champion Nico Rosberg, real estate mogul Manny Khoshbin, former tennis player Ion Țiriac and actor Mark Wahlberg.

The exterior of the car is designed primarily for aerodynamics. Notable aerodynamic features include the large front air inlets, the roof-mounted air intake and the large aerodynamic fin extending down the back half of the car.

Powertrain:

The powertrain of the Mercedes-AMG ONE is rated at 782 kW (1,063 PS; 1,049 hp) through a hybrid drivetrain that shares many features with modern Formula One cars. The car has five motors with different functions on board: one internal combustion engine (ICE) and four electric motors.

Internal combustion engine:

The Mercedes-AMG F1 W07 Hybrid (being driven by Lewis Hamilton in 2016). A car on which the engine and design of the ONE is based
The Mercedes-AMG ONE will utilise a modified 1.6-litre turbocharged 90-degree V6 engine from the Mercedes-AMG F1 W07 F1 car, as confirmed by Mercedes-AMG board member Ola Källenius. Modifications will be done to the engine due to the engine's illegality in RPM idle and redline. The head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers, states that the engine will be at 1,280 rpm when idle, and at 11,000 rpm when at its redline limit.[14] However, the engine will only last for 50,000 km (31,000 mi) and the owners will have to return their cars for engine refurbishment.[15] The ICE produces 422 kW (574 PS; 566 hp), with torque figures still unknown. The top speed of this car is 219 mph (352 km/h).

Electric motors:

The internal combustion engine will work in conjunction with four electric motors: a 120 kW (163 PS; 161 hp) Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K) coupled to the crankshaft, a 90 kW (122 PS; 121 hp) Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H) coupled to the turbocharger, and two 120 kW (163 PS; 161 hp) electric motors at the front axle. The MGU-K and MGU-H are Formula One-style motors responsible for recovering energy and improving efficiency during operation of the car. More specifically, the MGU-K serves to generate electricity during braking, while the MGU-H serves to eliminate turbocharger lag, improve throttle response by keeping the turbine spinning at high speeds and to recover wasted energy from the exhaust.[2] The final two electric motors drive the front wheels to allow for an all-wheel drive drivetrain, and the sum of these four electric motors will contribute 450 kW (612 PS; 603 hp) effective power to the total power output figure of the ONE.

Transmission:

The transmission will be a AMG SPEEDSHIFT 8-speed single-clutch automated manual transmission variant (similar to the type of transmission used in modern Formula One cars), and will deliver the bulk of the engine power and torque to the rear wheels. The use of a single-clutch over a dual-clutch transmission was due to AMG's engineers wanting to keep the car light and due to concerns over the dual-clutch's ability to handle the high-revving V6 ICE.

Wheels:

The ONE has wheels made of aluminium alloy and carbon fibre with diameters of 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear with centre-lock wheel nuts. The tyres are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2Rs with codes of 285/35 ZR 19 for the front and 335/30 ZR 20 for the rear. The brakes are ventilated carbon-ceramic discs.

Interior:

The interior is mostly minimalist and driver-focused, continuing the Formula One theme of the ONE. This includes a Formula One-style steering wheel and pedals, and a driver-oriented central infotainment screen. There are some traditional luxury features in the interior, notably napa leather and hand stitching on the bucket seats.

Chassis:

The body is made entirely of carbon fibre in line with its F1 counterpart, resulting in a final kerb weight of 1,695 kg (3,737 lb).

Performance:

Top-speed: 352 km/h (219 mph)

0-100 km/h (62 mph): 2.9 seconds

0-200 km/h (124 mph): 7 seconds

0-300 km/h (186 mph): 15.6 seconds
