How to install: copy every file from each driver inside the skin folder that you want.

Note: if there's already an ext_config.ini file in the folder made from the skin's author, don't overwrite it, open it and copy the text inside it (unless the code was from a previous helmet, in that case you can overwrite the file).

Changelog:

11/04/2025: updated all helmets and configs
