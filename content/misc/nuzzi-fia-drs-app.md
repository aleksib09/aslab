###### Assetto Corsa allows free use of the DRS regardless of being in a race session. This app enforces the FIA's DRS rules for AI drivers and the player.



**Info:**

Up to now, I have been using the free RARE app by Schmawlik to enforce FIA DRS rules. However, I decided to make my own as RARE has secondary features which I don't need. There can also be compatibility issues with my other apps. Here is the link to RARE for those who want it: https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/rare-rules-and-race-enhancements.52534/



**Compatibility:**

- Tested with all CSP versions up to CSP 0.2.7.
- CSP Preview versions may be buggy, this is due to CSP versions being beta and not this app.
