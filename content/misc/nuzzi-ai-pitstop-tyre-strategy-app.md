**This app allows you to define a tyre pit stop strategy for AI to use in races!**

  

  **Info:**

  Assetto Corsa has missed out on races with tyre pit strategies for far too long! This app really highlights the excitement: undercuts, overcuts and pitting in general can produce. You can customize the following:

  - AI's starting tyre compound.

  - Which laps the AI pit on (with an option to allow for their own deviation.)

  - Which tyres they put on at each stop.

    

  **Compatibility / Bug Info:**

  - Not compatible with CR Formula Cars.
  - Tested with CSP 0.2.7.
  - CSP Preview versions are not tested for and may contain bugs.
  - Not Compatible with wet weather.
  - Min CSP 0.2.6

- g beta and not this app.
