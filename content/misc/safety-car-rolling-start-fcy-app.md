This app brings the safety car for offline races with AI.

Rolling start is also available. A formation lap under limited speed is done after the start and the race begins when the pack is in last sector just before the start/finish line.



When incident occurs there is also yellow flag in the concerned sector. Cars can’t overtake in the sector under yellow flag and speed is also limited.



The Full Course Yellow (FCY) occurs when there is a major incident and the race is neutralized. Overtaking is not permitted and all cars must not exceed the speed of 80 km/h.



Like the FCY, the safety car is deployed when a serious incident occurred. All sectors are yellow-flagged and no car is allowed to overtake. The safety car will pick up the current leader at the start/finish line and lead the pack under limited speed until the caution is removed.



When the race is about to be resumed, you will get the “SAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP” displayed on the app. The safety car will continue to lead the pack until the pit entry where it goes straight to the pitlane. Wait for the signal and the flag going green to floor the throttle and race again.
