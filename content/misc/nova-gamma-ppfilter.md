HI! 
I present to you the best (in my opinion) ppfilter that I have published so far.

Realistic lights, great colors and script by Peter Boese. 
In the video you can see how the gameplay looks like



The filter comes in **two color grading variants**:


NOVAfilter - I used great color grading from user D-MAN, who I asked to use his color grading

NOVAfilter_base - has a different color variant.



I'm currently working on other color grading variants for the filter.



Download all files and paste them directly into the AC game folder.

It should load when selecting the setup filter with script settings. If not, click on Pure config during the game and import the settings !NOVA_1

Regards and have fun.

Thanks for being here :)
