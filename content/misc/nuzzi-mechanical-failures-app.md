####### ** Assetto Corsa has been missing out on Mechanical failures! Now, each driver (including you) has a chance of a mechanical failure occurring at a random point in the race.**



**Info:**

How engine failures look is based on the car, for example, the VRC F1 2005 car produces large amounts of Fire & Smoke!

When an AI driver has a failure, they will pull over off to the left side of the track to get out of the way of all other drivers.



**Other recommendations:**

- Use this app with the Clear Stopped AI App.



**CSP Compatibility:**

- Tested with all CSP versions up to CSP 0.2.7.
- CSP Preview versions may be buggy, this is due to CSP versions being beta and not this app.
- Min CSP 0.2.6
