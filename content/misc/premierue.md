Hey everyone, i appoligize to all of the delays, but PremierUE 1.0 is finally out now for Patreon Members! The PPFilter is defenitally in a spot right now where i would say it looks great in about 90% of lighting senarios, with complete darkness probably being its lowest point in my testing, ill be putting out a few updates soon that will aim to fix some of the minor oddities, but as a whole id say the filter is looking very nice! I thank you all so much for your patiance and support. As usual the download can be found in a seperate post for paid memebrs! I hope you all enjoy! :D
