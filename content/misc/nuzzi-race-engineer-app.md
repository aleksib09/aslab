**Assetto Corsa has no race engineer, which results in needing multiple visual apps to keep you informed of what is going on in: races, qualifying & practice sessions. This app provides a race engineer to keep you informed of session events, your car's status and as a way to receive vocal informative responses to any queries you have! This results in significantly more immersive and enjoyable experience.**



**Info:**

I have developed this app as my alternative to Crew Chief! I like Crew Chief, but I wanted a built-in app which fully supports Race and Qualifying sessions. For example, I noticed Crew Chief did not recognise cool down laps correctly in Assetto Corsa.



**This app provides drivers with a race engineer who will provide:**

- Voiced Random Info Updates
- Voiced Session Event Comments (Session Start/End, 1st Lap, Final Lap)
- Popup UI window (MFD) to ask the engineer for specific info. (My Position, Wind Info, Gap to car ahead, Tyre Temps, Car Damage etc)
- Responses to live events. (Qualifying Lap Invalidated, Low Fuel, Damage)



**Compatibility:**

- Tested with CSP 0.2.7.
- CSP Preview versions may be buggy, this is due to CSP versions being beta and not this app.
- This app is designed for offline use. (Some parts may work online, but it is untested.)
- Min CSP 0.2.6
