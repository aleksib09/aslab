This HUD is based on OV1's 2014 HUD with a little modifications and help. New textures as it was used from 2011 to 2013. For the DRS function I want to say thanks to Andreas Lorenz, who was really kind and helped me.

There are two version: A large and a small. The small is recommended for resolutions which are smaller than 1440x900, the bigger which are larger than 1440x900px.
