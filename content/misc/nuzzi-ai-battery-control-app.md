##### AI now manage their MGUK / ERS modes in race sessions!



**Info:**

Default Assetto Corsa AI drivers don't use MGUK / ERS modes in race sessions! They simply leave the mode in the default "balanced" mode, which is very unrealistic.



**Features:**

- AI change MGUK / ERS modes depending on:
  - Battery Level
  - Lap Deployment Allowance
  - Yellow Flags present (Works great with the Yellow Flag / VSC App)
  - Different behaviour between AI drivers. (Check below flow charts for more info!)
  - \+ More!



**Compatibility:**

- Tested with CSP 0.2.7.
- CSP Preview versions may be buggy, this is due to CSP versions being beta and not this app.



**Car Support/Compatibility:**

- Does not work with CSP versions of VRC formula cars as they have specialised energy strat modes.
- Does not affect cars with only Kers / Push-to-Pass.

- hould be compatible with all CSP versions.
