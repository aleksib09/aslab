##### This app allows you to have rolling starts with AI.



**Info:**

A number of people have mentioned to me how much they wish Assetto Corsa had rolling starts. Now you can! The AI will go slowly for the first lap and not overtake. Once the first driver starts the second lap, the race will begin! I have included a UI for the app to show the start lights.

(Note: AI drivers will follow in single-file.)



**You can customize the following, though optional:**

- Top Speed on rolling lap.
- AI's Throttle limit on the rolling lap.
- Start the race all at once or in classes.
- State which car C.M tags are to be used as classes.
- Gap between each group/class starts.



**CSP Compatibility:**

- Not compatible with CR Formula Cars.
- Tested with all CSP versions up to CSP 0.2.7.
- CSP Preview versions may be buggy due to CSP versions being beta and not this app.
- Min CSP 0.2.6
