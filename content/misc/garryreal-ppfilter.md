Expect another update soon.

This is the first of a two-part release that will make GarryReal the most customizable and versatile PP filter yet. For now, I've included only the stable effects, such as the option to have different presets for glare and night. Additionally, the GarryFx spice effect has been converted to HDR. If you come across any issues I may have missed, please let me know.

The full changelog will be included in version 1.26.
