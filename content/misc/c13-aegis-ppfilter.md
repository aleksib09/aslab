The wait is over! C13 AEGIS, my photo/camera realistic filter is finally here. A filter that truly accurately captures the aesthetic and dynamics of a camera, day and night, sun or rain. Featuring the most advanced AE system of any Pure filter available today, with precise glare and saturation control, to ensure optimal immersion every second behind the wheel. And the best news? It's available today, and it's 100% free.

If you're tired of the terrible choice between undersaturated drab filters on one hand, and oversaturated cartoons on the other, C13 AEGIS is the filter for you. C13 AEGIS features custom atmospheric simulation logic to help maintain a stable and accurate image no matter the conditions on track.

Developed with the help and support of AEGIS | VISUALS, this filter represents over 500 hours of work not including testing. It was enabled by the development of entirely new approaches to image management that are wholly unique to C13 AEGIS.

Enjoy it.

Sincerely,
Ciba

requires latest version of Pure to function correctly.
