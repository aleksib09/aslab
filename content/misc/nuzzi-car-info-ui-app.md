**This app takes inspiration from a part of EA (Code-masters) F1 Game's HUD. Specifically, the car status information popup. It allows players to press a button to temporarily show and cycle through a couple windows of car related, status information.**



The first page shows:

- Tyre Temps

The second page shows:

- Tyre Wear (Estimation, except for supported cars below.)
- Front and Rear Wing Damage
- Left and Right Body Damage
- Suspension Damage
- Engine Damage
- Gearbox Damage



**Info about Tyre Wear:**

- Tyre Wear is estimated for all cars not in the below supported list. This is due to limitations in reading wear in Assetto Corsa and scaling. So I have manually analysed it for accurate results for the below cars. (You can message me if you would like a car supported that isn't on the list.)

**Cars with Accurate Tyre Wear:**

- Kunos Ferrari F138
- Kunos Ferrari F2004
- Kunos Ferrari SF15t
- Kunos Ferrari SF70h
- Kunos Tatuusfa1
- Kunos Lotus Exos 125
- Kunos BMW Z4 GT3
- Kunos Mazda MX5 Cup
- Kunos Lotus 98t
- VRC Formula Alpha 24
- VRC Formula 2007 (Ferrenzo & McLenna)
- RSS Formula 2000
- RSS Formula 2010
- RSS Formula 2013
- RSS Formula 2017â€“2021
- RSS Formula 2 v6 2020
- RSS Formula 3 v6
- RSS Formula 4 2024
- RSS Formula Supreme
- RSS Formula Americas 2020 (+ Oval version)



**Controlling the App:**

- This app uses one player assigned button to control. You can assign whichever controller/steering wheel button you wish. I have added a little comment at the top of the Nuzzis_Car_Info_App.lua file included for details on how to do this.



**Other Info:**

- The app window will automatically close after a few seconds of inactivity. (Can be disabled if wanted.)



**CSP Compatibility:**

- Tested with CSP 0.2.7 and should be compatible with all CSP versions.
