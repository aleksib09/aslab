The HUD is totally based on OV1's F1 2014, with Mat Servant's and my textures. The HUD is one of the most realistic graphics for a video game. Base app for AC.

There are two version: A large and a small. The small is recommended for resolutions which are smaller than 1440x900, the bigger which are larger than 1440x900px.
