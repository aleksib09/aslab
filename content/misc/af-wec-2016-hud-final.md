Here is my WEC 2016 HUD (Final Version), which has realistic textures and working ERS bar. It is based on Andreas Lorenz's F1 2009 HUD. 

In the pack you find two version as always: A large and a small. The small is recommended for resolutions which are smaller than 1440x900, the bigger which are larger than 1440x900px.
