S K Y now combines all 3 art styles into one:
DRIVECLUB and D R E A M now near perfectly completed; Gran Turismo is next!

It took you long enough...
Okay, why the long wait? If you've been a patron for a while, you know I don't release buggy messes. Merging TWO... wait not two.. THREE entirely different art styles into one post-processing filter sounds exactly how it feels like: it's complicated and it needs to be done right. On top of that, I had to re-assess the overall look and feel of D C to make sure the DRIVECLUB vibe was indeed achieved.

While Pure emulates a more accurate color perception in the human eye, 
S K Y DRIVECLUB creates more depth by emulating and exaggerating illumination.

It is safe to say S K Y has hands down the most accurate depiction of DRIVECLUB's art style. The exposure, the rain, the colors, the atmosphere. Everything looks and feels right.

The previous release of 1.9 was a test bed of LCS's capability while also attempting to replicate the GCS version of S K Y D C. One notable thing from LCS is the ability to create proper hyper sensitivity in tunnels, which is important to capture the DRIVECLUB vibe.


Gran Turismo later this month!
This update took quite a bit of time. I did not have enough time to produce content and complete the Gran Turismo art style - now that everything are set, that means the Gran Turismo update will come soon. It will come later this month, ideally it should be out within a week or 2.

S K Y 1.9 will be free with D R E A M art style on Overtake.gg around the end of the month.

At rest...
Releasing this big update is the final straw. It ensures that S K Y stays updated regularly, ready for future Pure updates. Breakthrough after breakthrough, this has to be it.. more time for more content. If I somehow find another wall to break... well... crap.


Enjoy guys!
