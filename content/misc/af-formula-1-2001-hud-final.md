IMPORTANT! This HUD is based on Andreas Lorenz's F1 2009 HUD's files,which is based on the OV1 F1 2014 HUD, so it is not only my merit.

There are two version: A large and a small. The small is recommended for resolutions which are smaller than 1440x900, the bigger which are larger than 1440x900px.
