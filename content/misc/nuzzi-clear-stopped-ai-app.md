#### **This app removes stuck and stopped on track AI by teleporting them to the pits. In race sessions they will stay there retired, but in qualifying and track day sessions they will be able to rejoin.**

  

  **Info:**

  Assetto Corsa by default handles crashed, stuck and retired AI very poorly. Custom Shaders Patch helps this partially, however, this app solves the remaining issues.

  

  **CSP Info:**

  - Tested with CSP 0.2.7.
  - Min CSP 0.2.6
