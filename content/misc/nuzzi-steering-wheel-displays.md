##### I have made my own LCD screens for some cars. I've been disappointed by a number of cars either not having the info I need or not presenting info clearly. Having as much info clearly presented in the car rather than on UI apps is great for immersion!



**Car Screens Included:**

- Ferrari F2004, SF15t and SF70h by Kunos *(Default Assetto Corsa)*
- TatuusFa1 by Kunos *(Default Assetto Corsa)*
- All RSS Formula Hybrid F1 cars from 2017 to 2024 ([https://racesimstudio.com](https://racesimstudio.com/))
- RSS F4 2024 and RSS F4 2017 ([https://racesimstudio.com](https://racesimstudio.com/))
- VRC Formula Alpha 2023 and 2024 (Non CSP versions) ([VRC](/tags/vrc/))



**Note:**

- **Manual Installation is required**, I have added install instructions.
- These changes may affect online usage.
