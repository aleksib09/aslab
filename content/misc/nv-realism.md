NVREALISM LCS UPDATE

Hello, a new PPF update is here.

This time, the focus was on the new Pure LCS.
Which is now fully supported by the filter.

 Of course, LCS is a relatively new feature, so some older mods may not support it, or their textures might appear incorrectly, as well as other potential visual bugs.

!! Please note that this filter version is still in Beta !!

When using LCS, I have also updated the CSP settings, which are included in the download files.

The latest PPF showcase video was recorded using only Pure LCS and reshade.

If you have any questions or uncertainties, feel free to message in the Discord channel, in the general chat, or technical support channel.

Enjoy!

!!! Note !!!

Install the PPF manually by placing the extension/system folders from the download into your Assetto Corsa main folder.

For a more detailed installation process, check the #download-guide channel on Discord.
