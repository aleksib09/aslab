Union Island is one (of 32) island of St Vincent & the Grenadines. Located in the Caribbean sea, it has a population of around 3000 habitants. The summit reaches 999 ft (304m). It's a paradise for wind surfing. Driving? not so much... Luckily my roads aren't accurate, and made of asphalt, instead of the concrete real ones!

I took a lot of liberties redoing the island. I made it to scale, but the roads in real life are limited and all made of concrete. The West only has forest path for example, whereas i made perfectly raceable roads all around.
Please note it is not a racetrack, and you should drive accordingly :)
