Welcome to Topanga Canyon Hillclimb. It's a point-to-point sprint run up Topanga Canyon Blvd, a real public road located near Malibu, CA. It begins at sea level along the Pacific Coast Highway, stretching north 13 miles through the Santa Monica Mountains to a peak of 1,500ft before dipping back down slightly to it's conclusion at Mulholland Hwy. Compared to many hillclimbs, the slope is more gradual here and there are fewer tight hairpins which results in some particularly high speed runs. The road is narrow however, and the heavily wooded canyon makes for poor visibility. There are caution markers and tire barriers setup in some of the most deceptive areas, but a careless driver will quickly end up in the trees!

This is my first track release for AC. It's one of several tracks i've been working on, and is the culmination of over two years of learning, practicing, trying different techniques, and starting new projects but never finishing them. I'm finally making a push to get a few of them wrapped up and released.
