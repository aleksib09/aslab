***Goodwood Motor Circuit mod is created using LiDAR data. No guesswork involved.***

When I found LiDAR data of Chichester (thanks to our forum community), I have decided that existing old Goodwood circuit mod can go to pension. I feel like my version is significantly better already. Take Goodwood Revival or Members Meeting spirit some pre 70s cars and have fun.

What is LiDAR ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar

Don't be surprised that track is rather bumpy, it has many undulations, it is far from flat. Most cars feels very good, however few cars might feel not perfectly suited for this type of track and those are the ones which never raced in Goodwood.

Fake Wet layout is included for wet track placebo, don't be surprised that it is so slippery, 1"50 is a fast laptime at Goodwood when it is wet. Use alternative lines to get more grip, optimum lines has less grip. Pretty much first time in simracing when you'll have to search for grip in circuit :)

**Whats left to do:**
- Revise some existing elements and textures;
- Add more elements;
- Final revision, and all needed corrections, if found;
- Optimisation;

**SPECIAL THANKS**

- Andy Riches - For great help testing the track and preview videos;
- Berniyh - Great help testing and preview video;
- Norbs - For awesome camera sets;
- LilSki - For teaching about intensity data, and for a very nice set of trees textures;
- Kunos - for amazing sim, modding support and very comfortable modability.

Also big thanks for everyone who said nice words, motivating words, helping words.
