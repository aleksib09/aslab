SOME NOTES REGARDING LAST CSP VERSION

Some users have experiment issues with last CSP version with AI cars not starting the race All we can do about it right now is just to go back to an older CSP version and wait for a CSP fix.

Please note that if you restart the session, everything is OK the second time
