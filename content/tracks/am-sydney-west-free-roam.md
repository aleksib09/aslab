Point to point layout tips:- Run point to point races in in 'RACE' mode set to '1 Lap'. You can run at 100% Difficulty.

Traffic Layout tips:- Use Traffic Layout in 'Track Day' mode using CSP setting 'AI Flood' to spawn AI cars. Drive around map and AI will spawn on almost all main roads taking different routes as they drive. Ai cars can act a bit crazy in places, trying turning down difficulty and aggression level.

Pending your PC specs, game will run better if you use minimal car types. Try using 10 AI cars X only a few different model types. Mid to higher spec PC's should be able to run 20+ cars.
