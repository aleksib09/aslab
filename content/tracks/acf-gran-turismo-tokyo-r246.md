GTR2 conversion by stikazzi, converted to Assetto Corsa by ACF.

Fixes by Teddie: skybox, buildings, mountains, building dome. 

Fixes by Slider: Track lights, Grass FX and water configs. 

Fixes/additions by Mascot: corrected geotags/location; new tree/grass textures; manga billboards hidden/reskinned with GT/R246 branding; added GT/R246 balloons, blimp, dynamic choppers, airliner; retextured gantries and pit buildings with GT/R246 branding; many additional texture/nm tweaks around the track; bad floating cars removed; bad searchlight beams removed; reverse route fences reinstalled.

Track audio still buggy, awaiting CSP update. 

Thanks to Norms for dynamic chopper skin help.

This track isn't particularly accurate and has many fundamental issues but these tweaks have hopefully inspired somebody to make a scratch-built Tokyo R246 that's a lot more respectful to the source material. Thanks to Polyphony Digital.
