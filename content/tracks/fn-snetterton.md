###### I'm excited to share this track with you all. Finally we have a quality version of this iconic race track in our beloved sim.

Snetterton Circuit is located in Norfolk, England. Originally an airfield during World War II, it was converted into a race circuit in the 1950s. The track is known for its fast straights and challenging corners. It hosts a range of events, such as BTCC.
