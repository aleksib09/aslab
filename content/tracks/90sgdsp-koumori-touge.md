**KOUMORI TOUGE (蝙蝠峠)**

Local hashiriya called it "Zaike"(在家), Koumori Touge is located in Mie Prefecture, connecting Kameyama City and Iga City. Koumori means "bat" in English, there were no history regarding to the touge and the name, could possibly be naming after the shape of the terrain around.

Kameyama side contains different type of corners, a layout fitting for both drifters and grip racers. Rather strong steepness and a lot of straights makes downhill quite a thrill.
