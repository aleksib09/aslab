This track is made by scratch, using the original old psx mesh ( low poly - unplayable mesh) as a guide, so i can say that this track should has the exact road´s measurements and shape/height of the original Trial Mountain. Also, as you can check playing/viewing any GT6 version, the modern sony version still has the same shape of the original psx version ( obviously more detailed), so mine should has the same road flow than those moderns Gt5-gt6 versions.

Obviously, as i made it all by hand ( my poorly hands) , i cant make a exact copy of the surrounding landscapes, cliffs, and so on... So with this version you will have the same road flow with my own taste about everything all. Dont expect a very similar Sony´s version because i cant reach that level. I havent got the skills to keep the original style, but i will try to bring the community a good looking alternative version of Trial Mountain.

Im very slow making things in blender. I re-do a lot of things while im learning/finding new things, textures, and so on.. Dont expect i finish this track in two weeks... neither 2 months...

here some pics. I have the actual "step by step" thread in assettocorsamods dot net and here too.
