The 2017 Historic French Grand Prix was one of the most beautiful and large gathering of single-seaters. Races followed one another throughout the weekend under the amazed eyes of the spectators. 53 F1 cars gathered in the race allowed the public to plunge back into the chapters, from the 1950s to the 1990s, of Formula 1. In addition, many F1 cars from the 90's were on display, such as Michael Schumacher's Benetton B12 and the 1991 Williams driven by Tristan Gommendy. Jean Alesi, godfather of this first edition, also took to the Grand Prix track with his old Tyrrell 018 to the delight of his fans, who came to welcome him in large numbers to the Circuit.
