Kazekaeshi Touge (風返し峠). The most popular drift spot on the 'hashiriya heaven'-Mountain Tsukuba, since the 90s. 

Located at the highest point of the entire Tsukuba Skyline, it starts with an intersection to create an unique atmosphere compare to other touges. Even it has various anti-drift measurements, it is still the only undead hot spot in the area. 

This layout is downhill grip of the entire Kazekaeshi Touge.
