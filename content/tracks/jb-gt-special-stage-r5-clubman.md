***GT's Special Stage R5 and Clubman***

- Original track made by @vastchapa1980
- Version "2.0" enhanced by me and published under express permission by the original author.

CHANGELOG for this version:

- Only the 2 original layouts from GT.
- Fixed the folder and model naming to lower-case to prevent data bugs/loss
- Unified FX Config for both layouts
- Updated track surface texture, specularity fixed, as well as the bug that made the car lights reflect with an offset to the left.
- Fixed Hotlap start point and Starting Grid layout (proper traditional left/right instead of single file)
- Complete lighting overhaul, added light points at the gantries.
- RainFX implemented, GrassFX code simplified (the track has only one grass spot, on the statue hairpin, unreachable)
- Removed animated objects and track-side trucks
- Yellow bright "window" textures modified to glass material
- Some texture tweaks on the road signs and boards (might try to up the resolution on some but UV mapping is very wonky)

I did my best to try and update/improve the look and feel of this track where possible, and give it a little extra goodies.
2 or 3 buildings give also a bit of specular reflection to imitate "glass architecture", and the former lit "solid yellow stripes" are now real glass, which in my opinion masks a lot better the simple nature of that track asset and give a better look overall.
I hope you guys like it, it's not a "lilski-level" masterpiece (if you don't know who it is, you reaaaally should) as you all know, but it's made with love for sim-racing and the sim-racing community as well.
