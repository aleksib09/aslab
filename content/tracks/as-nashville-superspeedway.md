Nashville Superspeedway is a 1.33 mile (2.14 km) concrete tri-oval with an eleven turn 1.8 mile (2.9 km) infield roval layout. The track has 14 degrees in the corners, 9 degrees of banking in the front tri-oval, and 6 degrees of banking on the back straight. We developed Nashville Superspeedway from detailed LIDAR scan data. V0.9 includes 30 grid spots and oval AI, while roval AI will be added in a future update.
