Arrabassada is a busy road connected between Barcelona city and Sant Cugat del Vall√©s City.
It is also the main way to ascend to Mount Tibidabo, the highest point in Barcelona with views over the entire city.

Since its existence, this road has been a meeting point for motor lovers, even taking part in some illegal races, which is why in recent years the city council has put a lot of effort into reducing the danger of the road.


The recreated track begins on the urban highway and goes up until the crossroad to go to Tibidabo or Sant Cugat. This is a complete transition between 100% urban look to a mountain road, including two oil stations, viewpoints, sidings and parkings.
