**HAYATO TOUGE**

Hayato touge is just a nickname, there's nowhere called Hayato touge, but that's the mysterious calling of the spot. Somewhere deep in the mountains in Kanagawa Prefecture, it has been a drifting hotspot in the late 10 years.

As typical drift spots, it's just a very short section with 5-6 corners. However the entire section is narrow enough just to flick the car left and right. The excitement of this untouched area and ultimate close gallery viewing point make this spot hot til nowadays.
