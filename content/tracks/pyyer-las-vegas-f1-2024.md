### Get ready for the glitz, the glamour, and the high-speed action of Sin City! ðŸŽ°The Las Vegas F1 2024 Extension 2.0 is here, bringing the electrifying night race to life with updated details and enhancements for an even more immersive experience. 

**From the iconic Strip to the fast straights, it's time to light up Las Vegas! ðŸŒŸðŸ”¥**
**Please note that the extension had to be completely remodeled following the release of the new version of the track by Nukedrop.
