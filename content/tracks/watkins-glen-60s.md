Watkins Glen for Assetto Corsa by Sergio Loro. 

Grand Prix layout  3.700 mts, 30 Pit Box

Sportcars layout 3.708 mts, 30 Pit Box 

The track has options to use different levels of bumpiness and historical grids and for leagues. To use these options, copy the * .kn5 from the GRIDS and ROAD MESH subfolders into the main folder of the circuit. 

Watkins Glen, one of most iconic tracks in simracing, and in motor racing historic. This is my represetation of a late 50's or early 60's track.  For all GPL lovers, Watkins has a special place in our hearts. I hope this version rekindles those great memories and that you can enjoy it.

Special thanks to Willem Peters and Tim Muttran for maps and cams!! great work!!
