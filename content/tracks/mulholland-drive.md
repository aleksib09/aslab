This is Mulholland Drive, an 11 mile (17.7km) long mountain-top road in Los Angeles above Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, and the San Fernando Valley. Driving enthusiasts should not confuse this with Mulholland "Highway" however, which is further to the west near Malibu (although I DO have plans to create some of that road as well). This is the stretch between the 405 and 101 freeways, a two-lane road traversing a mix of both residential areas with narrow curbed streets and twisty scenic sections with dirt shoulders. A lack of guardrails in many places will leave you in constant danger of going over the edge if not careful, and the varying shoulder conditions will require some exploration to discover which corners can be cut and which curbs should be avoided!

Like my prior track release, Topanga Canyon, this too has been a bit of a back-burner project over the past 2 years just waiting for it's time to see the light of day. I've finally sat down and made a big push to get it buttoned up and released, as I have more projects (more canyon roads) in the works that I'm eager to focus my attention on.

Those who enjoy my Topanga Canyon track will hopefully find this one fun as well, and even better in many ways. It will have a familiar feel in terms of how it's constructed, but there is a lot more variation in the shoulder and curb types which I find to be important for a road to feel realistic. I've done without most of the hill climb event stuff on this one, stripping it back to really just a paddock at both ends and some road closure barriers along the route. There are some caution signs and corner markers throughout though, so if you see one of those you should probably take care
