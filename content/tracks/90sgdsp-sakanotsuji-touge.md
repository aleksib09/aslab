**<90s Golden Drift Spot Project>**

SAKANOTSUJI TOUGE (坂ノ辻峠), is located in Hyogo prefecture around Mountain Seppiko.

This is the only road connecting between Shiso City and Kamikawa Town, which means not only normal cars, but truck will also passing through this road. However due to the difficulty of this road, it's not easy for truck running.

The city council had been requesting a construction for Sakanotsuji Tunnel to replace the touge for a while, however the construction still nowhere close to start. That also decrease the usage of this touge, being more able to get overtaken by drifters and racers.
