Happy New Year to all of you! ü•≥Ô∏è
Are you ready for another year full of extensions? üòâ
For the first release of 2024, we will go to the N√ºrburgring GP track which was the first complete extension I released at RD more than two years ago. 

Obviously there have been a lot of improvements in two years and now is a good time for a complete redesign of the 2020 Eifel Grand Prix extension.  

But that's not all: it is now included in a Classics Pack with 2 completely new extensions!

And  the Bring It Back version will be released on January 7! üòÉ

.

Here are the details of the pack:

- New Layout: European Grand Prix 2003

- New layout: German Grand Prix 2011

- Remastered Layout: Eifel Grand Prix 2020 (fully redesigned)

- New Layout: Bring It Back 2023 (fantasy based on 2023 season style)

- Each layout with

Specific billboards

Specific animated boards

Specific fence boards

Specific brake markers & signs

Specific grounds sponsors

Specific gantries

Specific Rolex Clock model (2020, 2023)

Digital flags

DRS Lines and zones (1 zone 2011 - 2 zones 2020,2023)

Additional Pit building structures (2020, 2023)

Additional Bridge before T1 (2003)

New flags design (2023)

New VAO Patch

And more...

.

Enjoy! üòâ
