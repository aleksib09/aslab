This road is located in Ijmuiden, The Netherlands.

A short but very fun streetspot put in the spotlight mainly by the Polderlife crew.

Its perfect to run up and down back to back with a few drivers.

If you feel competitive, there is also an "illegal comp" style layout included, equiped with cones, clipzones and branding !
