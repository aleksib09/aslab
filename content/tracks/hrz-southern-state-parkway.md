The Southern State Parkway is a 25.53-mile parkway on Long Island, New York, in the United States. The parkway begins at an interchange with the Belt and Cross Island Parkways in Elmont, in Nassau County, and travels east to an interchange with the Sagtikos State Parkway in West Islip, Suffolk County, where it becomes the Heckscher State Parkway. The Southern State Parkway comprises the western portion of unsigned New York State Route 908M, with the Heckscher Parkway occupying the eastern section.

Regarded as one of the deadliest highways in the country for its elevation changes, potholes, curves and lack of shoulders... it is the adopted home track for many drivers in the Long Island area including many members of Team Get Active and their Community's Members.

We hope you enjoy our biggest project to date and any feedback is greatly appreciated!
