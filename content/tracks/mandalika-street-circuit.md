**About Circuit**

Mandalika International Street Circuit is located in the Mandalika resort area on the Central Lombok Regency in West Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia. The sports cluster and entertainment project, measuring 120 hectares, is expected to include the construction of hotels and other facilities [1]. It is claimed to be a street circuit as parts may be used in future, allowing normal traffic access to new resort facilities. Only the circuit's outer street track is accessible, not the circuit's main track, despite being public [2].

- Most of the track model is created from scratch by me, track model, objects, and landscape are made as close to the current real track condition
- 30 grid/pit stops available
- Fully working and highly competitive AI
- Working 2 DRS Zones, this circuit never hosts formula races here, so it's just my prediction where DRS activation will be located
