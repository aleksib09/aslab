**UPDATE 0.9:**
In this update i focused more on the trackside objects, but i fixed some clipping bugs  and further tweaked some materials to have a more realistic look 

- Off-track overhaul
- Added pitlane objects
- Added more grid slots, now we have 26 instead of 20 :)
- Tweaked materials
- Tweaked the surface grip levels, now the astroturf has much less grip

**UPDATE 1.0:**

Finally it is time to open this post to the public :D
In this update i focused more on the missing features and special requests 

- Updated a lot of materials
- New skidmarks, also in the pitlane

- Tweaked tyre marks and groove material

Update 1.2:

Please do a clean install with this update (delete old track folder)

Reworked vegetation: I planted almost 3000 trees manually based on real life footage.  The new vegetation should be much more representative of the track than the previous ad hoc made environment.

**Update 1.3:**

- New 2024 blue tyre barriers

- New grass and gravel traps

- Resurfaced asphalt

- Adjusted the height of the chicane curb based on real driver's feedback (now its a bit higher, so it will be more difficult to cut the chicane)

- Adjusted some ground paints to match real world

- New 2024 ui logo

- Working TV displays

- New Digital flag logic

- Tweaked some materials to be more realistic


**HOTFIX:**

- Fixed map.png for both layouts

- Fixed incorrect models.ini confog

- Fixed a bug in surfaces.ini

Please share the track with your friends, drive carefully and enjoy 

I recommend installing the track manually. Some people reported issues when installing with CM
