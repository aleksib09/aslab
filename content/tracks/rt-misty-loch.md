Nestled in the scenic mountains of Scotland, the track takes its name from the serene lake that borders part of the track.  The layout offers plenty of variation and challenges. Particularly challenging is the corksrew at The Misty Loch pub, and the fast slalom tree tunnel at the foot of Mount Majestic.

  Featuring:
   * 40 Grid spots
   * Normal and Reverse layouts
   * Night Lighting
   * Full seasons support
   * Wet weather support
   * Environmental audio

Track history - According to sources, the track was designed and produced for Blimey Games in 2008 by Stephen Viljoen, whose other designs include Alpental, Ambush Canyon, Glendale Raceway, and Bannochbrae. Misty Loch was featured exclusively in Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends. Now, converted and remastered for Assetto Corsa by 'Nobody', the track is finally available to be enjoyed by a much wider audience.
