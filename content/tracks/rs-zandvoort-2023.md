The 2023 Circuit Zandvoort track was renovated to host the Dutch Formula 1 GP. The track features two banked corners, which should provide faster cars with more overtaking oppertuneties. Run-off areas have also been looked at, with asphalt run-offs being installed in Tarzan, Masters and Hans Ernst corner. The pitbuilding has been repainted, and the track has Tecpro barriers installed around the circuit, and a NASCAR style SAFER barrier in the final turn.
