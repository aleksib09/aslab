I recreated one of my favorite tracks from the Gran Turismo series. Although I have the best memories of it from GT2, I tried building it the way it is in GT6 for a more modern look.



**Features**

- 3,5 km track
- 20 pits
- AI
- GT6 billboards or F1 skin
- TV cameras

Recently I learned using Blender a bit and I decided to finally start this project. It's a lot of work and I would rather take my time and never finish it, than rushing it and get it wrong. So for now don't expect a polished track, but it's already pretty fun in my opinion.

First I started converting crdriver63's track from rFactor 1, but I decided to start from scratch, as this would make my life in blender easier (so I can now work with beziers and stuff, instead of a converted fbx).

I didn't plan to release it in this state because I think many people will only download a track once and never update it (yes I'm guilty), but I will probably stop working on it for the next few months due to personal reasons... So I decided more people than just the few forum users can already enjoy it for a while.
But I still have big plans for the track and plan to continue building and improving it in the future.
Of course I will do some big fixing though, if anything pops up.
