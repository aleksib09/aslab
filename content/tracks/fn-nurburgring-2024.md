I am thrilled to present to you the new, modernized Nürburgring Nordschleife. Although it’s an early version and still requires some work, but it’s already in a good state that allows you to try out the new changes.

To kick off 2025, I’m excited to share a significant update for the Nürburgring, featuring two new layouts. I know I promised to release this update before Christmas, but I had to put in much more work before making it public. Unfortunately, I lost my 0.7 project file and had to redo almost everything starting from the 0.44 version.

Changes: 

- 2 new layouts: Sprint with both chicane variations

- Added lots of vehicles, and objects both to the GP circuit and the Nordschleife

- New sponsors

- Updated some buildings with a higher quality version

- Fixed popping lights

- Added many new light sources to the GP track and the Nordschleife

- Replaced old tyre barriers with new, higher quality versions on the GP track

- Fixed a lot of UV and Normal errors

- Deleted some unused trees

- New Pine textures

- Tweaked the whole vegetation 

- Added green travert at the chicane section

- Added some missing distance markers to the GP layout

- Added orange barriers 

- Animated Ferris wheel

- Fixed drs zones and map.png-s for all layouts

- Real sectors for the Nordschleife and the 24H layout

- Bunch of material improvements

- Added more flags 

And there is a lot more 

In the next update I plan to add even more layouts, yes the Tourist is also one of them :D
Add more camps and spectators to the 24H layout, also add spectators
Make all the 2025 changes (If you can spot any new updates please message me on discord, so i can make them)

As always, thanks for your support, be safe! 

Stay tuned for more updates!
