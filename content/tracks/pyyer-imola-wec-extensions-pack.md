Endurance racing is back at Imola—and Ferrari just took a stunning home victory last weekend! 🇮🇹🏆 
The Imola WEC Endurance Pack 4.5 includes both the 2024 and 2025 versions of the 6 Hours of Imola, bringing all the latest updates to this historic and technical circuit. Time to relive the action and feel the thrill of endurance racing in the heart of Italy! 🏎️🔥
[NOTE]
- Extensions are available for both KUNOS and FENRYR versions of the track
- WEC 2024 & 2025 look quite the same - it's a little bit "Spot the difference" 😅 but both versions have been fully optimized (and remastered for 2024) and should have no more issues (especially regarding z-depth)

Here are the features:

Layout WEC 2025

WEC 2025 billboards

WEC 2025 animated boards

WEC 2025 fence boards

WEC 2025 brake markers

WEC 2025 signs

WEC 2025 grounds

WEC 2025 Podium

WEC 2025 Pit names

Remastered Layout WEC 2024

Pit Names (WEC layouts)

Full Z-Depth optimization (all layouts)

Fix double brake markers (all layouts)

CSP version relative adjustments

New VAO Patch

Enjoy and have fun!🙂
