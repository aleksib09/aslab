Welcome to Santa Monica Mountains! This track mod is my recreation of the network of canyon roads nestled in the hills above Malibu, California. To create it I am employing a technique of photogrammetry in order to capture the actual roads with as much precision and detail as I can manage. For more information on the process and overall goal of the project, please refer back to my original forum thread HERE.
