This is a beautiful circuit staged near Lake Maggiore in Northern Italy, surrounded by the European Alps. A technical course of approximately 5.8km in length with many unique corners, combined with ascents and descents created by the hilly geography. The straight has an elevation change of 40m, and there is a 20 degree banked hairpin at the end of the hill, creating a driving experience like nowhere else.
